# Miles Prower Workshop

Welcome to the Miles "Tails" Prower Workshop!

This repository is my coding environment, designed for competitive programming contests. 

> **NOTE:** Don't forget to create `input.txt` next to `main.cpp`

Inspired by the brilliant mechanic famously known as **Tails the fox**, this workshop is all about speed, precision, and innovation.
