# Miles Prower Workshop

Welcome to (Miles/Hour)'s Workshop!  
(Call it Tails' workshop for short :P)

This repository is my personal coding environment in VSCode, designed for competitive programming contests. 

> **NOTE:** Don't forget to create `input.txt` next to `main.cpp`

Inspired by the mechanic genius famously known as **Tails the fox**, this workshop is all about speed, precision, and innovation.

Tails is ready to code at sonic speeds and reach new heights with ease!
