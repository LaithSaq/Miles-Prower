# Miles Prower Workshop

Welcome to the Miles-Prower Workshop!

This repository is my coding environment, designed for competitive programming contests. Inspired by the brilliant and agile Miles "Tails" Prower, the twin-tailed fox from the Sonic the Hedgehog series, this workshop is all about speed, precision, and innovation.

Get ready to code at sonic's speed and reach new heights with ease!
